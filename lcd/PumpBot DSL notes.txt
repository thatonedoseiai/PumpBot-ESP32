		//Text-based commands:
			drawtext(int size, int x, int y, bool alpha, uint8_t justify, uint8_t palette){
				.size = text size in pixels,
				.x = x location of text. origin determined by justify,
				.y = y location of text. origin determined by justify,
				.alpha = allows text to render behind transparent objects,
				.justify = changes the origin to one of 7 different locations, 
				//0 = Top Left, 1 = Top Center, 2 = Top Right, 3 = Center, 4 = Bottom Left, 5 = Bottom Center, 6 = Bottom Right.
				.palette = sets the color to one of the 5 palette colors
				// 0 = Background, 1 = Foreground, 2 = Selected(text), 3 = Selection(highlight), 4 = Grey-out.

				.opacity = opacity, //8 bit color - if 0, don't do math!
				.palette = sets the color to one of the 5 palette colors
